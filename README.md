Project Federated Clustering
==============================

In this work, secured Federated Clustering was implemented through Local Spike Distance Matrix(LSDM), Federated Euclidean Distance Matrix (FEDM) and Predicted Euclidean Distance Matrix (PEDM).

## Setup
~~~
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

do adjustments in src.main, then run
python -m src.main
~~~
